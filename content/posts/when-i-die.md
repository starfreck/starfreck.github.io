When I die  
when my coffin  
is being taken out  
you must never think  
i am missing this world  
  
don’t shed any tears  
don’t lament or  
feel sorry  
i’m not falling  
into a monster’s abyss  
  
when you see  
my corpse is being carried  
don’t cry for my leaving  
i’m not leaving  
i’m arriving at eternal love  
  
when you leave me  
in the grave  
don’t say goodbye  
remember a grave is  
only a curtain  
for the paradise behind  
  
you’ll only see me  
descending into a grave  
now watch me rise  
how can there be an end  
when the sun sets or  
the moon goes down  
  
it looks like the end  
it seems like a sunset  
but in reality it is a dawn  
when the grave locks you up  
that is when your soul is freed  
  
have you ever seen  
a seed fallen to earth  
not rise with a new life  
why should you doubt the rise  
of a seed named human  
  
have you ever seen  
a bucket lowered into a well  
coming back empty  
why lament for a soul  
when it can come back  
like Joseph from the well  
  
when for the last time  
you close your mouth  
your words and soul  
will belong to the world of  
no place no time
